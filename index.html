                <p>I have always been the type of person that does not easily fall to conformity. Indeed, if there was a
                    motto for which I could live by is that, change is important in my life. </p>

                <p>In trying to live by this motto, at times I have found myself in some very compromising situations.
                    At the same time, however; my constant urge to seek change has also led me to some wonderful
                    experiences. </p>

                <p>As I embark on this new adventure of my life that is coding, I hope to enter a world that can provide
                    change for me on a constant basis. Indeed, I am now beginning to realize that this was the correct
                    path for me to take. It is now up to me how far I want to go.</p>
